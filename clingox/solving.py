def approximate(ctl: Control) -> Optional[Tuple[Sequence[Symbol], Sequence[Symbol]]]:
    '''
    Approximate the stable models of a program.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ctl
        A control object with a program. Grounding should be performed on this
        control object before calling this function.

    Returns
    -------
    Returns `None` if the problem is determined unsatisfiable. Otherwise,
    returns an approximation of the stable models of the program in form of a
    pair of sequences of symbols. Atoms contained in the first sequence are
    true and atoms not contained in the second sequence are false in all stable
    models.

    Notes
    -----
    Runs in polynomial time. Returing an approximation does not mean that the
    program is satiafiable, only that this was not yet determined. This cannot
    be determined in polynomial time.
